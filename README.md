This CA requires us to write js codes that fetch data from API and dynamically render them to the DOM. I have created two html page to fulfill this requirements. these include:

Index page that fetch and render the collection of the jackets from the API and 

prodetails page that shows details of each of the products when clicked from the index page.

The entire project was achieved by making use of the Fetch, await and async function.

I also include some error handling using the try and catch method.

At the end, the site is deployd on netlify with the link:
